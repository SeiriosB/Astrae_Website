    "title": "About Us",
    "body": "    About Us  :                 Humans have always liked telling stories. It is a primal desire, one that has led to the creation of the various mythologies, epics, and all the art that surrounds us. The ability to capture the abstractions of our mind through words and drawings which then inspire ideas within others is what separates humans from all other living beings. We are almost limitless in our capability for self-expression. We have developed countless channels for self-expression over the years, be they sculptures, paintings, poems, dance forms, songs or, in our case, magazines! &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;        Quarks is IISc’s undergraduate magazine. But what does that actually mean? To us, Quarks is a way of communication. It is a statement we make collectively, a snapshot capturing various facets of the lives of the Undergraduate students in IISc. Since its inception in 2012, Quarks has offered the IISc community and the world a glimpse into undergraduate life at the institute. As one of the oldest UG initiatives, it has mirrored the growth of the program, chronicling many firsts that came with it – the first major selection, the first Mimamsa victory, the first college fest and the first graduation ceremony. And with them, it has captured the enthusiasm that comes with starting something new, being the pioneers staring into the unknown, along with their fears and uncertainties. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;                While the UG program is still ‘new’, it is no longer in its infancy. We are preceded by a long line of seniors and alumni who have set the standard of what the Undergraduates of IISc can achieve. We must acknowledge the contributions made by them and look at how our actions will influence the UG program in the years to come. Through Quarks, we hope to be able to capture these efforts as honestly as we can. And what better way to achieve this than to collect the stories from the people currently within the program? &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;                We need your help to achieve this. Tell us your stories! Tell us what you think at night before you go to sleep, tell us what you are passionate about, tell us about the best and worst days of your life, express yourself in any meaningful way possible. There is no limitation to language, length, genre or topic. If you aren’t fond of writing, draw something, or send us a picture! Send us a poorly drawn comic, or a list of dad jokes you really like, or a description of how you feel when you finally submit all your pending assignments on Teams. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;                Channel your creativity and let Quarks be your platform! We are here to watch and learn. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;         Thanks and Regards,         Aviral Sood (Coordinator)         Shloak Vatsal (Chief Editor)                                         Shloak Vatsal                                           Aviral Sood                       &lt;!–   The Team:             Team Member 1                       Team Member 1                     Team Member 2                      Team Member 2                     Team Member 3                       Team Member 3                     Team Member 4                       Team Member 4             –&gt; "

    "body": "2025/12/14 - Author: Animesh Pradhan As another semester winds to a close, we organised a general observation session dedicated to the bright Geminids meteor shower. With the skies above Bangalore finally clearing up, the heavens offered us a wonderful opportunity to watch one of the brightest meteor showers of them all, with lots of stars to boot. People from various departments in IISc, along with some guests came together to watch the shower. The chilly weather forced everyone to wear jackets and use blankets, but only ended up strengthening their resolve to watch just another meteor. Some of us tried taking continuous short exposure shots to capture meteors, an effort which mostly didn’t yield fruit(The last image here is one the few that had a meteor in it, look at the streak in the top-left). As people from all walks of life came together, forgetting the worries of the day for just one night, to lie down and try seeing as many meteors as possible. While my personal meteor count only went to 16, many people managed to get as many as 22 within a few hours of skywatching. Not everyone managed to make their wishes in time though, as each meteor only lasted a second or two at most, the longest ones going to about 3-4 seconds. Each streak of bright light in the heavens was followed by excited shouts, and a tinge of disappointment for those who happened to be looking at the wrong direction. Most meteor showers occur when Earth’s orbit passes through the debris trail left by a comet, where the debris falls in and burns up in the atmosphere forming the meteors we awe at. The yearly Geminid shower, however, are formed by a debris trail of an asteroid, 3200 Phaethon. It is one of only two major meteor showers associated with an asteroid and among the most prolific of them all. Meteor showers derive their name from the constellation where the origin point of the meteor lie, i. e. the point where all the meteor trails, when extended, converge. This point, called the radiant, lies about 34-53 arcminutes from Castor, the second brightest star of Gemini. The observation session concluded on a positive note, with people going back home with memories to remember, long after the night was gone. Only time will tell however, what wishes come true, and what remains, the fault in our meteors. . Clear Skies! "

    "body": "2025/08/15 - Author: Animesh Pradhan Kicking off a new semester filled with exciting sessions, we started with the first talk on a series to explain Astrophysics to beginners and challenge the enthusiasts as well. Have you ever wondered how we know that we are safe from any asteroid impact for atleast a decade? Or how did we figure out that Oumuamua was an interstellar object? The answers to these questions lie in the elementary but surprisingly involved and beautiful theory of Celestial Mechanics. The talk began with a screening of the documentary of “How the Universe Works”, followed by a detailed dive into the mathematics of Celestial Mechanics, building from the basic foundations laid by Kepler. Instead of solving the equations of planetary motion via the standard rotational pseudo-potential method, we analyzed the differential equation itself in detail, building a solution from the ground up via the constants of motion. Using the beautiful concept of the eccentricity vector(also called the LRL vector), we found the trajectories of motion both in the regular coordinate frame as well as a beautiful result in the phase space. We then tried to analyse the solutions for the three-body problem and the multi-body problem, leading to discussion on the famous Lagrange points and the Virial Theorem. Finally we discussed the various types of binary systems and the methods to estimate their masses as well as orbital parameters. The talk ended on a exciting note, as we simulated the trajectory of Oumuamau, wondering about the consequences of the various hypotheses explaining its puzzling, extra-gravitational acceleration. The lecture notes of the talk have been attached below. Clear Skies! Lecture Notes:     This browser does not support PDFs.

We also got a solar filter, a Canon T ring M42 and a GSO 2x SA Barlow 1. 25” to do astrophotography using a Canon DSLR with the telescope, and a universal mobile adapter to do astrophotography using smartphones with the telescope. This kit of equipment is extraordinary for beginners to learn optical astronomy observation techniques as well as optical astrophotography.

He ventured to topics like stages of the life of the universe and at what stage structures like galaxies started emerging out, how the galaxies form, how they evolve with time and how these phenomena can be studied. He showed a few simulations including the Millennium simulation. These simulations do agree with the observed structure of the universe. The visuals were really mind boggling! Simulated galaxies and real one were so alike that one could not tell easily which one is which unless one has a good expertise with simulated and observed images of galaxies.  "

A very good virtue one can learn from the life of Dr. Narayanan is that he advertises his plan only after it has been executed successfully.
