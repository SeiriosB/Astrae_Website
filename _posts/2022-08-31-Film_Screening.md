On August 05, 2022, with a great joy- and excitement-felt heart, the Astrae Club joined the screening of the biopic of an ISRO scientist Dr. Nambi Narayanan, Rocketry: The Nambi Effect. It was so nice to watch the real life stories of  Dr. Vikram A. Sarabhai, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, Dr. Nambi Narayanan and Prof. Satish Dhawan. The moment of celebrations, the eureka moment, was when the indigenous VIKAS engine broke the record of the French VIKING engine with the ‘big number’ of 180 seconds! A very good virtue one can learn from the life of Dr. Narayanan is that he advertises his plan only after it has been executed successfully. He is bestowed with the Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award in the Republic of India. The hall echoed with shouts of rejoice and freedom as the film ended.
