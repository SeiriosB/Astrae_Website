August 01, 2022, the idea presentation day of the astrophotography and image processing workshop, was the day when the Astrae Club got it's first mentor, Prof. Aloke Kumar (Dept. of Mech. Engg.). Although being an expert in fluid mechanics, Prof. Kumar has a keen interest in astrophotography and image processing. He finds the analogies between earthly experiments in fluid mechanics and the mechanics of astronomical fields like interstellar medium and astrophysical plasmas. Such fluid mechanical phenomena can be studied by imaging the object of study. This motivated him to do astrophotography and this way the Club got a new learning opportunity!

He has shared his work on his blog: [Aloke Kumar's Blog](https://thedrashta.blogspot.com/)
