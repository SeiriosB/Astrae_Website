On August 13, 2022, the Astrae Club got into a heated discussion on orbital mechanics. We derived the basic equations of the planetary orbits. There was an elaborate discussion on the most fuel efficient way to get a rover to different planetary orbits like Mars orbit or Moon orbit or Venus orbit or orbiting Jovian planets, etc. We discussed how elliptical transfer orbits are the best and so on... We also talked about close fly-by and gravitational assist by Jupiter, Moon, Venus, etc.

This discussion was followed by a Spaceflight Simulator challenge. Spaceflight Simulator is a simulation based app which can be used to get a real feel of spaceflights. We discussed how to build rockets, landers and rovers in Spaceflight Simulator, launch them to the desired orbits and land them on the Moon, Mars, Venus, etc.
