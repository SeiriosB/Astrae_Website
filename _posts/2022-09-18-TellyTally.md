On Monday, August 29, 2022, sponsored by Kalam Labs, Astrae got a new telescope 🔭 to haunt the night skies... It's an 8-inch Night Watch Newtonian Reflector Telescope with a Dobsonian mount from Guan Sheng Optical (GSO), Taiwan, and supplied by Tejraj & Co., Mumbai, India. We also got a solar filter, a Canon T ring M42 and a GSO 2x SA Barlow 1.25" to do astrophotography using a Canon DSLR with the telescope, and a universal mobile adapter to do astrophotography using smartphones with the telescope. This kit of equipment is extraordinary for beginners to learn optical astronomy observation techniques as well as optical astrophotography. Here's the link to the supplier's page: https://tejraj.com/gso-8inch-dobsonian-telescope.html

We also have an older telescope which is a 6-inch Galaxy-II Newtonian Reflector Telescope with a Dobsonian mount from Sharp Vision Scientific Co., India. It was donated to the club by a professor at IISc sometime before the COVID-19 pandemic.

Let's bring the skies closer...
