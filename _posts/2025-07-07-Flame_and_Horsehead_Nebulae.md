title: "Flame and Horsehead Nebulae"
author: "Astrae Team"
description: >
  A dense molecular cloud shaped like the head of a horse, the Horsehead Nebula (slightly right of center) serves as a cradle for newborn and young stars. 
  It is a dark nebula—a cloud so dense that it obscures light from background stars and other nebulae. 
  Slightly left of center lies the Flame Nebula, an emission nebula surrounding a young cluster of stars. 
  At least one hot, massive O-type star within emits high-energy photons, ionizing hydrogen and other atoms, creating a flame-like glow upon recombination. 
  Near the bottom-left corner is Casper the Friendly Ghost Nebula (M78), a reflection nebula, along with many other nebulous objects scattered throughout the frame. 
  Captured from the Challakere campus of IISc using a 200 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~2 hours.
