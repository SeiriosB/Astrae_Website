August 07, 2022 was the scheduled launch of the ISRO's SSLV-D1/EOS-02 Mission. It had the AzaadiSAT satellite on board along with the Earth Observation Satellite-02 (EOS-02). It was the first development flight of the SSLV-D1/EOS-02 Mission. The AzaadiSAT was very special. Its payloads were built by girl students from rural regions across India. The payloads were integrated by a student team of "Space Kidz India". A detailed overview of the mission is given on ISRO's website: ISRO's SSLV-D1/EOS-02 Mission

Kenil, Gaurav, Deep, Vivek and Tasmay went to Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota to witness the launch. Here are some of the pics published by ISRO and a few clicked by Kenil.
