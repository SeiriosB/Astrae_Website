As another semester winds to a close, we organised a general observation session dedicated to the bright Geminids meteor shower. With the skies above Bangalore finally clearing up, the heavens offered us a wonderful opportunity to watch one of the brightest meteor showers of them all, with lots of stars to boot. 


Clear Skies!
