On August 06, 2022, Shashank Dattathri of the IISc UG batch of 2016 delivered a talk on galaxy formation and dynamics. Shashank got admitted as a Ph. D. student at the Yale University in August 2022. He ventured to topics like stages of the life of the universe and at what stage structures like galaxies started emerging out, how the galaxies form, how they evolve with time and how these phenomena can be studied. He showed a few simulations including the Millennium simulation. These simulations do agree with the observed structure of the universe. The visuals were really mind boggling! Simulated galaxies and real one were so alike that one could not tell easily which one is which unless one has a good expertise with simulated and observed images of galaxies.
